# trackpi
This is a complete MVVM design pattern project in .NET Core.

The project simulates a user dashboard to manage IoT tracking devices. 

The app reads location of each device from MySQL and displays the devices subscribed by the user in database.

It also includes a simple login/logout mechanism.
